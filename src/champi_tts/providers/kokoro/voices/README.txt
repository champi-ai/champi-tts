Kokoro Voice Directory
====================

Place your Kokoro voice files (.pt) in this directory.

Voice files should be PyTorch tensors saved with torch.save().
You can download voice files from the Kokoro project or create your own.

Example usage:
- af_bella.pt
- af_sarah.pt
- am_adam.pt

The voice name (filename without .pt) will be used to identify the voice.
